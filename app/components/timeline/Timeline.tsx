    title: "Sr. Computer Specialist",
    employer: "University of Washington",
    details:
      "As the Sr. Computer Specialist, I spearheaded a major upgrade to our Java-based systems, transitioning from Java 8 to Java 11 while integrating robust X.509 certificate authentication. This ensured secure communication between Jira, Confluence, and our custom LDAP service. I didn’t just update libraries—I re-envisioned the entire server architecture, reducing the server footprint from 7 to 5 by migrating from CentOS 7/Postgres 13 to Ubuntu 22.04/Postgres 16, which significantly reduced technical debt and streamlined system performance. Alongside these technical improvements, I created a comprehensive Atlassian guidebook, simplifying complex system administration tasks and user workflows. My cleanup of unused assets led to over a 200% improvement in system indexing speeds. I also introduced change management protocols that reduced untested code deployment in production, greatly minimizing errors.",

    title: "Senior Technical Support Engineer",
    employer: "Carbon Robotics",
    details:
      "During my tenure at Carbon Robotics, I was instrumental in transforming the company’s technical infrastructure. I spearheaded the rollout of Jira Software and Confluence across the entire organization, driving 100% user adoption through meticulous planning and execution. I also developed an internal Python/Flask web application with Redis to manage our support accounts, improving team efficiency by 10%. Beyond development, I worked directly with Product and Engineering teams to help shape the company’s technical future, collaborating on an MVP written in TypeScript and Go. One of my key initiatives was automating the generation of weekly custom performance reports, reducing a 16-hour manual process to just 2 hours. My leadership extended to team growth, where I helped scale support operations from a small 6x16 to a robust 7x24 schedule, growing the team from 2 to 10 engineers. I created onboarding programs that seamlessly integrated 7 new engineers in just 4 weeks, and I was the primary escalation point during crucial support hours, ensuring high customer satisfaction.",
