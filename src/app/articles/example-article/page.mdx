# Introduction

When youâ€™re building a website for a company as ambitious as Planetaria, you need to make an impression. I wanted people to visit our website and see animations that looked more realistic than reality itself.

To make this possible, we needed to squeeze every drop of performance out of the browser possible. And so Animaginary was born.

```js
import { animate } from '@planetaria/animaginary';

export function MyComponent({ open, children }) {
  return (
    <animate.div
      in={open}
      animateFrom="opacity-0 scale-95"
      animateTo="opacity-100 scale-100"
      duration={350}
    >
      {children}
    </animate.div>
  );
}
```
